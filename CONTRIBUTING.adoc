== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[code of
conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report

== Using GitHub issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage question
ask it with an issue with the `Question` tag or on https://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow]. The Koin team and the
broader community monitor the https://stackoverflow.com/tags/koin[`koin`]

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much
information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small samples project (or gist) that reproduces the
problem.


== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* We use the Kotlin standard formatting convention
* Make sure all new `.kt` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.kt` files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where `XXXX` is the issue number).


== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ] or
https://developer.android.com/studio/[AndroidStudio]


=== Building from source
To build the source you will need to install
https://gradle.org/[Gradle] v4.7 or more.

We use Gradlew in the build scripts


==== Default build
The project can be built from the root directory using the script:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./install.sh
----

NOTE: you can use the `test.sh` and `install.sh` scripts to test all modules and make local install


== Integration tests

the `koin-test` module gather all test against `koin-core`. Here you'll found most of usecase tests.

The following command script launch all tests from projects:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./test.sh
----
