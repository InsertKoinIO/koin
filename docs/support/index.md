The Koin team is leading its development with open-source and community-driven approach since the beginning, and propose commercial services to secure your development.

## Releases Cycle

We drive our developments with release cycles of 6 months to follow Kotlin language and library updates in a consistent manner. We will use beta periods of 6 weeks or more, to help gather first feedbacks.

Once a new version is released, we start the Community support phase for 6 months minimum. During that phase, we are actively gathering feedbacks, following all updates impacting our framework, like libraries, Kotlin Android, Ktor and others frameworks versions.

## Establishing Roadmap with Structured Versions 

The first big thing for the Koin project is organizing release cycles to establish a clear vision on versions deployment, and to help you anticipate updates and new features. We need a clear version tracking: `Major.Minor.Patch`

- Patch version: fixes only, minor dependency library updates
- Minor version: New features & deprecations
- Major features: New Impacting features, deprecations & hard breaking

We now drive our developments with release cycles of 6 months to follow Kotlin language and library updates in a consistent manner. We will use beta periods of 6 weeks to help gather first feedbacks.

## Community or Commercial Support

Behind our will to build a vision with a roadmap, we also know that many companies are engaging their business while they are using Koin to build their solutions and applications.

[Kotzilla](https://www.kotzilla.io/), the company of the authors of Koin, propose strong corporate support: [long-term support versions](https://www.kotzilla.io/support/).
