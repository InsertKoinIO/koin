title: Managing Android Scopes
---


## Taming the Android lifecycle

Android components are mainly managed by their lifecycle: we can't directly instantiate an Activity nor a Fragment. The system
make all creation and management for us, and make callbacks on methods: onCreate, onStart...

That's why we can't describe our Activity/Fragment/Service in a Koin module. We need then to inject dependencies into properties and also
respect the lifecycle: Components related to the UI parts must be released on soon as we don't need them anymore.

Then we have:

* long live components (Services, Data Repository ...) - used by several screens, never dropped
* medium live components (user sessions ...) - used by several screens, must be dropped after an amount of time
* short live components (views) - used by only one screen & must be dropped at the end of the screen

Long live components can be easily described as `single` definitions. For medium and short live components we can have several approaches.

In the case of MVP architecture style, the `Presenter` is a short live component to help/support the UI. The presenter must be created each time the screen is showing,
and dropped once the screen is gone.

A new Presenter is created each time

```kotlin
class DetailActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    // injected Presenter
    override val presenter : Presenter by inject()
```

We can describe it in a module:


* as `factory` - to produce a new instance each time the `by inject()` or `get()` is called

```kotlin
val androidModule = module {

    // Factory instance of Presenter
    factory { Presenter() }
}
```

* as `scope` - to produce an instance tied to a scope

```kotlin
val androidModule = module {

    scope<DetailActivity> {
        scoped { Presenter() }
    }
}
```

:::note
 Most of Android memory leaks come from referencing a UI/Android component from a non Android component. The system keeps a reference
on it and can't totally drop it via garbage collection.

## Scope for Android Components

### Declare a scope

To use a scoped Android component, you have to declare a scope for your component with the `scope` block like follow:

```kotlin
class MyPresenter()
class MyAdapter(val presenter : MyPresenter)

module {
  // Declare scope for MyActivity
  scope<MyActivity> {
    // get MyPresenter instance from current scope 
    scoped { MyAdapter(get()) }
    scoped { MyPresenter() }
  }
}
```

### Use an Android scope

Koin offers `ActivityScope` and `FragmentScope` classes, to let you use directly a declared scope for Activity or Fragment:

```kotlin
class MyActivity : ActivityScope() {
    
    // MyPresenter is resolved from MyActivity's scope 
    val presenter : MyPresenter by inject()
}
```

If you can't use such classes, we need to use the `AndroidScopeComponent` interface and implement the `scope` property. This will setup the default scope used by your class.
This `scope` property can be used with the following property delegates, regarding your component:
- `activityScope()` - Follow Activity lifecycle
- `activityRetainedScope()` - Follow Activity's ViewModel lifecycle 
- `fragmentScope()` - Follow Fragment lifecycle, and is linked to parent's scope
- `serviceScope()` - Follow Service lifecycle

:::note
`ActivityScope` class will use a `activityScope()` and `FragmentScope` class will use `fragmentScope()` by default.
:::

```kotlin
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity, AndroidScopeComponent {
    // get current Activity's scope
    override val scope : Scope by activityScope()
    // MyPresenter is resolved from MyActivity's scope 
    val presenter : MyPresenter by inject()
}
```

We can also setup a scope, tied to a ViewModel with the following:

```kotlin
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity, AndroidScopeComponent {
    // use Activity Retained Scope
    override val scope : Scope by activityRetainedScope()
    val presenter : MyPresenter by inject()
}
```


## Sharing instances between components with custom scopes & Scope Links

In a more extended usage, you can use a `Scope` instance across components. For example, if we need to share a `UserSession` instance.

First declare a scope definition:

```kotlin
module {
    // Shared user session data
    scope(named("session")) {
        scoped { UserSession() }
    }
}
```

When needed to begin use a `UserSession` instance, create a scope for it:

```kotlin
val ourSession = getKoin().createScope("ourSession",named("session"))

// link ourSession scope to current `scope`, from ScopeActivity or ScopeFragment
scope.linkTo(ourSession)
```

Then use it anywhere you need it:

```kotlin
class MyActivity1 : ScopeActivity() {
    
    fun reuseSession(){
        val ourSession = getKoin().createScope("ourSession",named("session"))
        
        // link ourSession scope to current `scope`, from ScopeActivity or ScopeFragment
        scope.linkTo(ourSession)

        // will look at MyActivity1's Scope + ourSession scope to resolve
        val userSession = get<UserSession>()
    }
}
class MyActivity2 : ScopeActivity() {

    fun reuseSession(){
        val ourSession = getKoin().createScope("ourSession",named("session"))
        
        // link ourSession scope to current `scope`, from ScopeActivity or ScopeFragment
        scope.linkTo(ourSession)

        // will look at MyActivity2's Scope + ourSession scope to resolve
        val userSession = get<UserSession>()
    }
}
```
