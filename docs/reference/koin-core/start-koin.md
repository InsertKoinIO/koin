title: Start Koin
---


Koin is a DSL, a lightweight container and a pragmatic API. Once you have declared your definitions within Koin modules, you are ready to start the Koin container.

### The startKoin function

The `startKoin` function is the main entry point to launch Koin container. It needs a *list of Koin modules* to run.
Modules are loaded and definitions are ready to be resolved by the Koin container.

.Starting Koin
```kotlin
// start a KoinApplication in Global context
startKoin {
    // declare used modules
    modules(coffeeAppModule)
}
```

Once `startKoin` has been called, Koin will read all your modules & definitions. Koin is then ready for any `get()` or `by inject()` call to retrieve the needed instance.

Your Koin container can have several options:

* `logger` - to enable logging - see <<logging.adoc#_logging,logging>> section
* `properties()`, `fileProperties( )` or `environmentProperties( )` to load properties from environment, koin.properties file, extra properties ... - see <<properties.adoc#_lproperties,properties>> section


:::info
 The `startKoin` can't be called more than once. If you need several point to load modules, use the `loadKoinModules` function.
:::

### Behind the start - Koin instance under the hood

When we start Koin, we create a `KoinApplication` instance that represents the Koin container configuration instance. Once launched, it will produce a `Koin` instance resulting of your modules and options.
This `Koin` instance is then hold by the `GlobalContext`, to be used by any `KoinComponent` class.

The `GlobalContext` is a default JVM context strategy for Koin. It's called by `startKoin` and register to `GlobalContext`. This will allow us to register a different kind of context, in the perspective of Koin Multiplatform.

### Loading modules after startKoin

You can't call the `startKoin` function more than once. But you can use directly the `loadKoinModules()` functions.

This function is interesting for SDK makers who want to use Koin, because they don't need to use the `starKoin()` function and just use the `loadKoinModules` at the start of their library.

```kotlin
loadKoinModules(module1,module2 ...)
```

### Unloading modules

it's possible also to unload a bunch of definition, and then release theirs instance with the given function:

```kotlin
unloadKoinModules(module1,module2 ...)
```


### Stop Koin - closing all resources

You can close all the Koin resources and drop instances & definitions. For this you can use the `stopKoin()` function from anywhere, to stop the Koin `GlobalContext`.
Else on a `KoinApplication` instance, just call `close()`


## Logging

Koin has a simple logging API to log any Koin activity (allocation, lookup ...). The logging API is represented by the class below:

Koin Logger

```kotlin
abstract class Logger(var level: Level = Level.INFO) {

    abstract fun log(level: Level, msg: MESSAGE)

    fun debug(msg: MESSAGE) {
        log(Level.DEBUG, msg)
    }

    fun info(msg: MESSAGE) {
        log(Level.INFO, msg)
    }

    fun error(msg: MESSAGE) {
        log(Level.ERROR, msg)
    }
}
```

Koin proposes some implementation of logging, in function of the target platform:

* `PrintLogger` - directly log into console (included in `koin-core`)
* `EmptyLogger` - log nothing (included in `koin-core`)
* `SLF4JLogger` - Log with SLF4J. Used by ktor and spark (`koin-logger-slf4j` project)
* `AndroidLogger` - log into Android Logger (included in `koin-android`)

### Set logging at start

By default, By default Koin use the `EmptyLogger`. You can use directly the `PrintLogger` as following:

```kotlin
startKoin {
    logger(LEVEL.INFO)
}
```


## Loading properties

You can load several type of properties at start:

* environment properties - load *system* properties
* koin.properties file - load properties from `/src/main/resources/koin.properties` file
* "extra" start properties - map of values passed at `startKoin` function

### Read property from a module

Be sure to load properties at Koin start:

```kotlin
startKoin {
    // Load properties from the default location
    // (i.e. `/src/main/resources/koin.properties`)
    fileProperties()
}
```

In a Koin module, you can get a property by its key:

in /src/main/resources/koin.properties file
```java
// Key - value
server_url=http://service_url
```

Just load it with `getProperty` function:

```kotlin
val myModule = module {

    // use the "server_url" key to retrieve its value
    single { MyService(getProperty("server_url")) }
}
```
