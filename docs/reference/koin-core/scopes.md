Koin brings a simple API to let you define instances that are tied to a limit lifetime.

## What is a scope?

Scope is a fixed duration of time or method calls in which an object exists.
Another way to look at this is to think of scope as the amount of time an objectâ€™s state persists.
When the scope context ends, any objects bound under that scope cannot be injected again (they are dropped from the container).

## Scope definition

By default in Koin, we have 3 kind of scopes:

- `single` definition, create an object that persistent with the entire container lifetime (can't be dropped).
- `factory` definition, create a new object each time. Short live. No persistence in the container (can't be shared).
- `scoped` definition, create an object that persistent tied to the associated scope lifetime.

To declare a scoped definition, use the `scoped` function like follow. A scope gathers scoped definitions as a logical unit of time.

Declaring a scope for a given type, we need to use the `scope` keyword:

```kotlin
module {
    scope<MyType>{
        scoped { Presenter() }
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Scope Id & Scope Name

A Koin Scope is defined by its: 

- scope name - scope's qualifier
- scope id - unique identifier of the scope instance

:::note
 `scope<A> { }` is equivalent to `scope(named<A>()){ } `, but more convenient to write. Note that you can also use a string qualifier like: `scope(named("SCOPE_NAME")) { }`
:::

From a `Koin` instance, you can access:

- `createScope(id : ScopeID, scopeName : Qualifier)` - create a closed scope instance with given id and scopeName
- `getScope(id : ScopeID)` - retrieve a previously created scope with given id
- `getOrCreateScope(id : ScopeID, scopeName : Qualifier)` - create or retrieve if already created, the closed scope instance with given id and scopeName


### Scope Component: Associate a scope to a component [2.2.0]

Koin has the concept of `KoinScopeComponent` to help bring a scope instance to its class:

```kotlin
class A : KoinScopeComponent {
    override val scope: Scope by lazy { createScope(this) }
}

class B
```

The `KoinScopeComponent` interface brings several extensions:
- `createScope` to create scope from current component's scope Id & name
- `get`, `inject` - to resolve instances from scope (equivalent to `scope.get()` & `scope.inject()`)

Let's define a scope for A, to resolve B:

```kotlin
module {
    scope<A> {
        scoped { B() } // Tied to A's scope
    }
}
```

We can then resolve instance of `B` directly thanks to `org.koin.core.scope` `get` & `inject` extensions:

```kotlin
class A : KoinScopeComponent {
    override val scope: Scope by lazy { newScope(this) }

    // resolve B as inject
    val b : B by inject() // inject from scope

    // Resolve B
    fun doSomething(){
        val b = get<B>()
    }

    fun close(){
        scope.close() // don't forget to close current scope
    }
}
```

### Resolving dependencies within a scope

To resolve a dependency using the scope's `get` & `inject` functions:  `val presenter = scope.get<Presenter>()` 

The interest of a scope is to define a common logical unit of time for scoped definitions. It's allow also to resolve definitions from within the given scope

```kotlin
// given the classes
class ComponentA
class ComponentB(val a : ComponentA)

// module with scope
module {
    
    scope<A> {
        scoped { ComponentA() }
        // will resolve from current scope instance
        scoped { ComponentB(get()) }
    }
}
```

The dependency resolution is then straight forward:

```kotlin
// create scope
val myScope = koin.createScope<A>()

// from the same scope
val componentA = myScope.get<ComponentA>()
val componentB = myScope.get<ComponentB>()
```

:::info
 By default, all scope fallback to resolve in main scope if no definition is found in the current scope
:::

### Close a scope

Once your scope instance is finished, just closed it with the `close()` function:

```kotlin
// from a KoinComponent
val scope = getKoin().createScope<A>()

// use it ...

// close it
scope.close()
```

:::info
 Beware that you can't inject instances anymore from a closed scope.
:::

### Getting scope's source value

Koin Scope API in 2.1.4 allow you to pass the original source of a scope, in a definition. Let's take an example below.
Let's have a singleton instance `A`:

```kotlin
class A
class BofA(val a : A)

module {
    single { A() }
    scope<A> {
        scoped { BofA(getSource() /* or even get() */) }

    }
}
```

By creating A's scope, we can forward the reference of the scope's source (A instance), to underlying definitions of the scope: `scoped { BofA(getSource()) }` or even `scoped { BofA(get()) }`

This in order to avoid cascading parameter injection, and just retrieve our source value directly in scoped definition.

```kotlin
val a = koin.get<A>()
val b = a.scope.get<BofA>()
assertTrue(b.a == a)
```

:::note
 Difference between `getSource()` and `get()`: getSource will directly get the source value. Get will try to resolve any definition, and fallback to source
value if possible. `getSource()` is then more efficient in terms of performances.
:::

### Scope Linking

Koin Scope API in 2.1 allow you to link a scope to another, and then allow to resolve joined definition space. Let's take an example.
Here we are defining, 2 scopes spaces: a scope for A and a scope for B. In A's scope, we don't have access to C (defined in B's scope).

```kotlin
module {
    single { A() }
    scope<A> {
        scoped { B() }
    }
    scope<B> {
        scoped { C() }
    }
}
```

With scope linking API, we can allow to resolve B's scope instance C, directly from A's scope. For this we use `linkTo()` on scope instance:

```kotlin
val a = koin.get<A>()
// let's get B from A's scope
val b = a.scope.get<B>()
// let's link A' scope to B's scope
a.scope.linkTo(b.scope)
// we got the same C instance from A or B scope
assertTrue(a.scope.get<C>() == b.scope.get<C>())
```
